# CoffeeShop

This project is for practice, and even more important, for fun. (Still working on this project).

Future plans for the website is to implement an individual page for products to specify details, and a payment page

This website also uses a Java-backend, that will need a bit more polishing before publishing. The backend is a REST API initialized with Spring boot. 

## Images

The images in this project is not perfect...yet. Will update images when the remaining pages are done.
