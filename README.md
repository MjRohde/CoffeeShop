# CoffeeShop

This project is for practice, and even more important, for fun. (Unfinished).

Future plans for the website is to implement a page with options for the customers, and a page for payment. 

This website also uses a Java-backend, that will need a bit more polishing before publishing. The backend is a REST API initialized with Spring boot.
